# Mapping_Earthquakes
Creating interactive maps using GeoJSON data, D3, JavaScript, and Leaflet.

The purpose of this project is to show the relationship between tectonic plates and the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. This visulatization includes three different global map views (Streets, Satellite, Night) which the user can toggle between, as well as three additional optional overlays for tectonic plates, earthquakes, and major earthquakes (4.5+). The legend at the bottom right-hand corner contains a range of colors: light green for the smallest earthquakes (0-1 magnitude) through red for larger earthquakes (5+). The markers correspond to the strength of the earthquake: the higher the magnitude, the larger the bubble. When a circle marker is clicked, a popup appears containing information about the magnitude and the location of the earthquake.
